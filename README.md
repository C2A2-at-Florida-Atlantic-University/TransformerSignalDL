# TransformerSignalDL

The purpose of this repository is to train a Transformer network for the purposes of wireless signal classification.
The dataset is from DeepSig, named RadioML2016, and contains I/Q samples.
We can train the network either with I/Q data or Spectrogram data.

# Steps to train:

1. Extract the RadioML2016 dataset and import the .dat file in the data folder.
2. Run the python script of your choosing.

# Action items:

1. Utilize positional encoding on spectrogram data for optimal model performance.
2. Allow the network to be trained on the RadioML2018 dataset as well.
